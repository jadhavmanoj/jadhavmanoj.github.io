This is an experiment to create website using <a href="https://blog.getpelican.com/">pelican</a>. 

Pelican is a static site generator, written in Python, that requires no database or server-side logic.

Interesting thing is we can easily add blog etc.

It was cool experience to get hand dirty with Pelican.
